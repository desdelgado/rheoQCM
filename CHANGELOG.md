# Changelog

## [0.17.0] - 2019-03-18

### Added

- Add spinBox for selecting index for displaying property in table.  

### Changed

- Change data structure. Copy some keys in settings_init to settings_default to keep enough information of data collecting parameter.  
- Change the way to getting display data from all harmonic together to by harmonics.

### Fixed

- Fix property of none calculated index value which is signed to value from other rows.  

## [0.16.1] - 2019-03-14

### Added

- Add manual fitting report to UI
- Add export raw to right click menu in data plots.
- Add fix phi=0 for the conductance/sursceptance peak fitting.
- Add function that record data without fitting.

### Changed

- Change reference claculating strategy.
- Change property table colunms auto generated by max harmonic.

## [0.16.0] - 2019-02-27

### Added

- Add window state check before resize it.
- Add text fontsize to customize settings.
- Add calibration file check.
- Add error log function.
- Add key check to user settings (Add missed key from settings_default)

### Changed

- Change the harmonic related widgets to be generated by program. (Leave only the first manually added in UI.)
- Change the harmonic related widgets settings and loading methods.
- Change DataFrame filter to regex to read data from a given harmonic.
- Change the way import data from other software (e.g.: QCM-D) to make it possible to customize the format for import and applicable for different formats (QCM-D and QCM-Z).
- Change channel selection when the same analyzer channel selected.
- Hide reference time items to simplify the setup process. The reference time will always be the first time starting the experiment.
- Improve the peak tracking method.

### Fixed

- Fix the span setting failure when peak tracking failed.
- Fix temp lines deleting bug.
- Fix delete selected raw data bug when it doesn't exist.

## [0.15.3] - 2019-02-07

### Fixed

- Fix the manual refit mode turning on/off bugs.
- Fix indexing bug while picking single point from data with marks.
- Fix refit not updating bug.
- Fix devided peak not plotting bug.

## [0.15.2] - 2019-01-29

### Changed

- Change the peak tracking strategy. The changing setp sometimes might be too big.
- Change the saving protocol while testing. Save both raw and data after each data acquization.

### Fixed

- Fix the fitting range line bug when fitting is failed
  
## [0.15.1] - 2019-01-18

### Added

- Add setting frequency range to myVNA for display data in it, in case it is needed to check data out of Python program.
- Add base frequency check for property claculation in UI. Now, the base frequency set in UI will be used as f1 when first harmonic data is not collected.
- Add load calibration file when switch channel

### Fixed

- Fix program crashes when collecting data with VNA disconnected on Windows  
  
## [0.15.0] - 2019-01-15
